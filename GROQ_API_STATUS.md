# Groq API Integration Status

## Current Issue

The voice chatbot is currently unable to generate AI-powered questions because the Groq API key is invalid or expired. The system will fall back to predefined questions until this is resolved.

## Error Details

- **Error**: `401 Invalid API Key`
- **API Key Status**: Invalid or expired
- **Current Behavior**: Using fallback questions instead of AI-generated questions

## How to Fix

### Step 1: Get a New API Key

1. Go to [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
2. Sign in to your account (or create one if needed)
3. Navigate to the **API Keys** section
4. Click **"Create API Key"**
5. Give it a name (e.g., "Voice Chatbot")
6. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Update Your Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env` file in your project root
2. Replace the current API key with your new one:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY=your_new_api_key_here
   ```
3. Save the file

### Step 3: Restart the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing the Fix

1. Open the browser console (F12)
2. Start a voice conversation
3. Look for these messages:
   - ✅ `Voice Chatbot: Groq API configured. AI-generated questions enabled.`
   - ❌ `Groq API Key is invalid or expired` (if still not working)

## Fallback Behavior

The voice chatbot is designed to work even without Groq API:
- **With working API**: Dynamic, context-aware questions generated by AI
- **Without API**: Predefined medical assessment questions (still functional)

## API Key Format

Valid Groq API keys start with `gsk_` followed by alphanumeric characters.

Example: `gsk_ABC123...`

## Need Help?

If you continue having issues:
1. Check the [Groq Documentation](https://console.groq.com/docs)
2. Verify your account has API access
3. Check for any billing or quota restrictions
